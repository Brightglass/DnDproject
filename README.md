# DnDproject
Hello! Brightglass here, this marks my first interaction github as a creator.
My skills in code are Python , C++, and golang. other than C++, they are beginner-intermediate skills.

This is a project from data structure project, it is about management of adventuring parties and where they are assigned to.

It is a simple code.

Update and polish is still in thought process
